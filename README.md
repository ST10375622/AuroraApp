# Aurora

This is a personal budget tracker app. The name of my app is Aurora. This app will allow individuals to manage their money.
This app exists as it will help individuals set out a budget and it will help the individuals 
to eneter their income and any expenses. Some of the innovative features that I will be implementing are notifications, gamification features, reports and graphs. 
The notification feature will alert the user when they are about to go over budget.
The gamification features include badges for every month that the user does not go over budget and rewards for every time they enter their expenses. 
Reports and graphs will be created to ensure that the user is aware of where they are in their finances, this was a very common feature among the different apps that I researched.
